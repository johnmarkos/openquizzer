The city's position on the Seine River made it a natural hub for trade and governance.</p><p>Today, Paris is home to over 2 million people in the city proper and over 12 million in the metropolitan area, making it the most populous urban area in the European Union.</p>",

      "explanation": "Mercury orbits at an average distance of about 58 million km from the Sun.",
      "detailedExplanation": "<p>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun, orbiting at an average distance of 57.9 million km. Despite being closest, it is <strong>not</strong> the hottest — Venus holds that title due to its thick greenhouse atmosphere.</p><p>A year on Mercury (one orbit) takes just 88 Earth days, but a single day-night cycle takes 176 Earth days because of its slow rotation.</p>",
